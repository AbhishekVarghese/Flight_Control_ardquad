Arduino Based Flight Control System

Contains arduino code for custom drone as well as a custom controler. 

Both the drone and the controller were built from scratch using raw materials such as wood, aluminium, etc.

This was a personal project. If used please don't forget to set the PID values again for your drone to avoid any accidents.
